# Meeting information

The Meeting Information App aims to simplify meeting management by providing 
a centralized platform for creating, scheduling, and organizing meetings. Through 
thoughtful implementation and continuous improvement, the app can enhance 
productivity within an organization. Users with the necessary permissions can create 
meetings, specifying details like title, date, time, duration
